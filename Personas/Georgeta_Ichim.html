				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>
					Georgeta, a retired woman in her late 70s, leads a quiet life. She spends most of her time at home, occasionally visiting her family. Georgeta has always been someone who shied away from new technologies and smart devices. She found them complicated and unnecessary. However, her nephews recently created a Facebook account for her, hoping to bring her into the social environment of the internet.

Georgeta, with her limited experience in using smart devices, finds herself facing numerous challenges. Her age has taken a toll on her senses, and she has poor sight and hearing. Walking has also become difficult for her, making even simple tasks around the house a challenge. Nevertheless, she is determined to overcome these obstacles and achieve her goals.

One of Georgeta's practical goals is to manage her finances effectively. She wants to ensure that her hard-earned savings are well taken care of and that she can easily access and track her accounts. However, when she tries to use financial apps, she often becomes frustrated with the overwhelming number of features that she doesn't understand. The complexity of these apps makes her question whether technology is really worth it.

Georgeta also has a personal goal of becoming more independent in her use of the internet. She wants to be able to browse websites, connect with her family and friends on social media, and send emails without constantly relying on others for help. However, the internet feels like a vast and intricate maze to her. She finds it overwhelming and challenging to navigate. Every website, every app, and every tool seems complicated and hard to comprehend.

Moreover, Georgeta's poor sight makes her eyes sensitive to bright colors. When she encounters websites or applications with vibrant and flashy designs, her eyes start to hurt, further adding to her frustration. She wishes that technology would consider the needs of older adults like her and provide options for a more comfortable user experience.

Despite her frustrations, Georgeta is open to learning and understanding smart devices. She recognizes that technology is becoming increasingly intertwined with daily life and wants to adapt to these changes. However, she wishes that the learning process could be simplified and made more accessible to people like her.

Although Georgeta is retired and content with her achievements, she also has concerns about the future. Setting a will for her nephews is another practical goal she wants to accomplish. She hopes to navigate the legalities and processes of creating a will efficiently, without being overwhelmed by the complexities of legal jargon or confusing online platforms.

Georgeta's journey into the digital world is not an easy one. She faces numerous frustrations and pain points as she attempts to understand and use technology. However, with determination and the support of her nephews, she strives to overcome these challenges. Georgeta hopes to embrace the digital era, manage her finances effectively, stay connected with her loved ones, and ultimately achieve a sense of independence in this rapidly changing world.
