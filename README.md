# GeRC-Gestural-Remote-Control

Design a smart personal assistant which makes use of natural means of interaction – for example, gestural, (pseudo-)haptic – in order to control certain home appliances such as BluRay players, fridges, kitchen robots, washing machines, TV sets, and others. For a proper interaction, propose a set of gestures to be used to control these (classes of) home appliances. The status of each controlled appliance can be viewed/changed via a smart device (phone, tablet, TV, conversational physical user assisstant).
